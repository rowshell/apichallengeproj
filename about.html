  <h1><center><u>About</u></center></h1>

  <p>Black Market Buddy is a presentation and evaluation of the impact that items introduced in the game
  mode <i>Black Market Brawlers</i> had upon different champions.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Each item has its own page, complete with an organizable table of champions and statistics. We
  have provided analysis of Win Rate and KDA both before the introduction of the game mode and during
  it. In order to maintain accurate results, only summoners which purchased a single Black Market Item
  were included in the statistics.  Our goal is to provide an easy way to tell whether or not an item was
  beneficial or detrimental to each champion.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  From the item page, a champion page can be accessed. Along with displaying a purty picture, the item
  which proved to help the champion the most (in terms of Win Rate and KDA) and the item which hurt the
  champion the most are displayed. This is determined through a comparison of Win Rate and KDA both before
  and during the game mode.
