  <p>Black Market Buddy is a presentation and evaluation of the impact that items introduced in the game
  mode <i>Black Market Brawlers</i> had upon different champions.  By averaging the changes in Win Rate and KDA from 
  before and during the new game mode, our analysis has concluded that the Trickster's Glass was a fine piece of 
  craftsmanship, while the Flesheater may have been slightly dented during delivery.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Each item has its own page, complete with an organizable table of champions and statistics. We
  have provided analysis of Win Rate and KDA both before the introduction of the game mode and during
  it. In order to maintain accurate results, only summoners which purchased a single Black Market Item
  were included in the statistics.  Our goal is to provide an easy way to tell whether or not an item was
  beneficial or detrimental to each champion.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  From the item page, a champion page can be accessed. Along with displaying a purty picture, the item
  which proved to help the champion the most (in terms of Win Rate and KDA) and the item which hurt the
  champion the most are displayed. This is determined through a comparison of Win Rate and KDA both before
  and during the game mode.

  <i>I built Dead Man's Plate on Ahri!  Why does it say "Unplayed?"</i>
</p>
<p>
  Was your team happy with you?  Anyways, building a tank item on a squishy caster is pretty unusual and probably
  didn't happen very often.  Our item tables only include champions that built that item multiple times, so that we
  can keep accurate results.  Otherwise, we might end up with people thinking tank Ahri will be played in LCS because
  one person managed to do well.
</p>
<p>
  Want to see the trolls?  We've added a setting to the item pages to change the minimum number of games a champion
  needed to have built an item to be included in the data.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Wait what's going on?  Some champions have a "worst" item that made their stats go up (or vice-versa).</i>
</p>
<p>
  Some champions just did very well (or very poorly) in the new game mode.  Take Syndra, for example.  Before the game
  mode, she had a less than stellar performance, with only 39% Win Rate and 2.7 KDA.  During <i>Black Market Brawlers</i>, 
  summoners built smart items on her, and she showed improvement with her worst BMI actually improving her scores.

<p>
  <i>Caitlyn built Flesheater, a melee-only item?</i>
</p>
<p>
  Apparently.  We were just as surprised (and a little afraid our data was wrong) until we started interviewing friends,
  and discovered that many of them didn't bother to read "Melee Only" and thought it would be OP on someone like Jinx.
  So the same thing happened as if you had built Hydra on another ADC: it just sat there, taking up space.

<p>
  <i>Where's all of Gangplank's data?</i>
</p>
<p>
  Gangplank didn't feel too great following the sinking of his ship.  As it turns out, every match from the dataset provided
  was from during his period of deactivation.
